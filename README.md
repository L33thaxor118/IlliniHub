#### Create and find nearby events in real time with a visual map interface. Demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duyHozF6Rx0


## Discovery Radius
Find events passively by expanding or shrinking the discovery radius. As you move, you will get push notifications for events that fall into this radius.

## Event Filtering
Swipe up the filter drawer and tap on some tags to enable or disable them. When a tag is enabled, only events containing that tag will be displayed. You can also search for tags with the searchbar.
